Not done.

Only init commit.

## Prerequisites

1. poetry as python package manager

## Development guidelines

- create a '.env' file in root, with key-value pair(s) like "sample.env"
- .vscode/settings.json should only contain machine-agnostic settings.
- git merge from master branch for latest updates
- git rebase onto master when there're merge conflicts in pull requests
